# This file is not yet integrated into the generators. The reason is that the
# logic from the interactions_meta variable in the workflow builder needs to
# be double checked and ported into here. The logic in that variable only
# currently holds for the interaction confromance tests; not necessarily for
# the basic search params tests. But, as it is refined and confirmed, it should
# be added into here as well. Then, rather than hard-code the interactions_meta
# variable, just load it up from this file into a memoized variable contained
# within the Interactions module. So, currently, the interactions_meta variable
# is being used, but as this file and the Interactions module is built out, the
# dependency should be on this.
