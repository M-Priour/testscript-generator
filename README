IGExtractor
  - Handles unpacking and loading in FHIR Implementation Guides (IGs) in either .zip or .tgz format. Looks for IGs to be loaded in the `./igs` directory

IGResource 
  - Class for storing the IGs as they're processed by the IGExtractor.

TestScriptWorkflow
  - Given an IG and a target interaction ('create', 'read', etc.), creates the workflow for the 
  TestScript designed to test this interaction. Conceptually, a 'workflow' defines, through its structure, what needs to be accomplished in each section of the TestScript, what information needs to be persisted between the sections, and how that information should be used. 

Generator 
  - Utilizes the IGExtractor and TestScriptWorkflow classes to first determine what interactions a conformant FHIR Implementation ought to be able to handle and then to generate workflows to guide the TestScripts that will test these interactions. Finally, it translates the workflows into TestScripts and outputs hem as JSON files in the 
  `./testscripts` folder. 

Driver
  - Currently, the primary method for running this Generator.
